# A Digital Logic Library for Arduino and Arduino Compatibles
A digital logic function library created with and for Arduino and compatible devices by Richard Martino.

# Background
I created this for a digital logic class I was taking at my community college. The professor had us do most of our labs with Arduino (all others were done with TTL ICs). He allowed me to create a library of digital logic functions we used regularly and reuse it for all of our labs. He did not allow reuse of old code from previous labs and thus this library was created. Mostly out of necessity.

# Prelude/Warning
Veteran programmers will cringe when they see this heap of garbage. This is elementary code written by someone who was unfamiliar with coding practices (and still is despite focusing his M.S. on Computer Engineering!) and microprocessors in general. With that being said, this is a usable lab and is intended for those who like to tinker.

I am not that familiar with GitHub so I will mostly be writing about this in further detail on my [blog](https://richardmartino.me).
